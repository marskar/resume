My primary research interest is in understanding health risk factors by combining scientific expertise from diverse fields with machine intelligence.\\ I believe I am uniquely equipped to bridge the gaps between scientific disciplines and deliver on the promise of data science in health research.\\ My preferred tools are R and Python, open source programming languages kept on the cutting edge by their active and supportive communities.\\ Through research and teaching, I am constantly improving my ability to obtain, tidy, explore, transform, visualize, model, and communicate data.\\  I aim to utilize my technical skills and science background to become a leader among the next generation of multidisciplinary data scientists.
